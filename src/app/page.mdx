# Zaymoriel Vandrell

I build and write about systems that must survive real-world constraints.

My work centers on software architecture, performance, trade-offs, and the discipline required to ship and sustain production systems over time. I am particularly interested in how systems behave under pressure in production, at scale, under failure, and across years of maintenance.

Currently building [VaultZen](https://vaultzen.dev) and serving as CTO at [Lombok Kode](https://lombokkode.my.id), focused on practical systems designed to last.

This site is where I publish long-form essays and technical reflections on engineering, decision-making, and the craft of building software that holds up.
